# Home Assistant Add-on: emontx sniffer

## About

You can use this tool to read radio packets sent by an [emontx](https://docs.openenergymonitor.org/emontx3/overview.html) and route them to the [emoncms add-on](https://github.com/Open-Building-Management/emoncms)

Disabling bluetooth is required if using cards attached to the GPIO and using ttyAMA0 such as [emonPi](https://docs.openenergymonitor.org/emonpi/index.html) or [RFM69Pi](https://docs.openenergymonitor.org/emonbase/rfm69-pi.html).

Check documentation to achieve this.
